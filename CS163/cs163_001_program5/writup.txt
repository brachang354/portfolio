Bradley Chang CS163_001 Program #5 Efficiency writeup

a. How well did the data structure selected perform for the assigned application?
	The data structure selected was a graph and it performed well for our application of storing locations and their description and being able to connect locations to each other directionally.

b. Would a different data structure work better? If so, which one and why…
	I don’t think another data structure would work better since a graph allows us to connect the locations to each other based on their relationship and no other data structure can allow for this kind of connection.

c. What was efficient about your design and use of the data structure?
	Inserting locations into the graph as vertices, and connecting up vertices had an O(N) performance. We only need to traverse once to find an empty spot to put a vertex, and when we need to traverse to find matching vertices to connect.

d. What was not efficient?
	The display function was not very efficient as it would have a O(N^2) performance due to its double repetitiveness of looping through the indices, and traversing the edge list in each index.

e. What would you do differently if you had more time to solve the problem?
	I would like to make my vertex insert work similar to that of a stack since I would like to take advantage of an array’s ability to have direct access to its indices.
